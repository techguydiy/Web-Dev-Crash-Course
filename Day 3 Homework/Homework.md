#Day 3 Homework

<h1>Day 3 Homework Tasks</h1>

<p>Take the script we wrote today that added the swiperight and swipeleft class. And style those to make the .decision-overlay div show red for swipe left and green for swipe right. Look into making an opaque background color so you can still see the image through the overlay.</p>

<p>Take the script that we wrote for jQuery mobile to trigger the swipe. Use raw javascript or jQuery (not mobile) to rewrite. Utilize the combination of "touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend" to calculate where they touched and if they moved to the left of the right...if the x coordinate increase or decreases from where it began. This is fairly complicated so don't get frustrated if you can't pull it together.</p>
